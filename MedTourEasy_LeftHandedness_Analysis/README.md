# Do Left-Handed People Really Die Younger?  
**Internship Project – MedTourEasy**

## About the Project  
I worked on this project during my internship with **MedTourEasy**.  
The aim was to find out whether left-handed people actually live shorter lives than right-handers — a claim that has often been repeated but rarely tested carefully.

## What I Did  
- Studied real-world data on age and handedness.  
- Looked at patterns across different generations to see how left-handedness changed over time.  
- Created simple charts to compare left- and right-handers.  
- Interpreted what the data really meant, rather than just what it seemed to show.

## What I Found  
The idea that left-handed people die younger turned out to be **misleading**.  
It only looked that way because older generations had fewer recorded left-handers — not because left-handers actually lived shorter lives.  
Once that bias was understood, the difference disappeared.

## What I Learned  
This project taught me how important it is to question first impressions in data.  
Sometimes what looks like a clear pattern is actually just the result of how the information was collected or recorded.
