COVID-19 Global Dashboard (Excel)

This is a COVID-19 dashboard I built in Excel to turn raw numbers into something thatâ€™s easier to understand at a glance. Instead of scrolling through tables of data, you can quickly see which countries were most affected, how recovery looked across different regions, and how the pandemic spread around the world.

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights from the Dashboard

- **Overall Statistics:**

- Confirmed cases, Active cases, Recoveries, and Deaths at a global level.

- Country-Level Analysis:

- Top 10 countries with the highest active cases.

- Top 5 countries with the highest infection rate (%).

- Top 5 countries with the highest recovery and death rates.

- **Continent-Level Trends:**

- Distribution of confirmed cases across continents.

- Average recovery rates by continent.

- **Comparative Analysis:**

- Confirmed vs. Recovered cases (Top 10 countries).

- Confirmed vs. Death rate (Top 10 countries).

**Geographic Risk Map:**

- Mortality risk levels visualized globally (High, Moderate, Low).


**Tools & Techniques Used**

- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation.

- Charts & Visualizations: Bar charts, Pie charts, Line graphs, and Geographic map visuals.

- Dynamic Design: Easy to interpret and visually appealing, showing both absolute numbers and percentages.

ðŸš€ Purpose
This project was my way of practicing data storytelling â€“ not just crunching numbers but presenting them in a way anyone can follow. It also shows how powerful Excel can be when it comes to analyzing and visualizing real-world data.
