# 📊 Statistics Project in Python

## 🔍 Overview
This project applies core concepts of statistics using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.  
The goal is to explore statistical methods hands-on, test hypotheses, and interpret results through practical examples and datasets.

## 🗂️ Repository Contents
- `StatisticsProject.ipynb` → The main Jupyter Notebook with code, outputs, and explanations  
- `StatisticsProject.html` → Static HTML version of the notebook for easy viewing without Jupyter  

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
  - Pandas (data manipulation)  
  - NumPy (mathematical operations)  
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)  
  - SciPy / Statsmodels (statistical analysis)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

## 📈 Key Highlights
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, etc.)  
- Data visualization to explore distributions and relationships  
- Probability distributions and sampling  
- Hypothesis testing (t-test, ANOVA, etc.)  
- Interpretation of results in plain language
