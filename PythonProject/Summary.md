# Social Media Usage and Academic Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the impact of social media usage on students' academic performance. Using a dataset provided by Career247, the analysis aims to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights between daily screen time, academic outcomes, and student well-being.

## 🗂 Dataset
- The dataset contains information on students' social media usage, academic scores, and related attributes.
- Columns include: Daily Usage (hours), Academic Score, Stress Levels, and more.

## 🔑 Objectives
1. Load and understand the dataset structure.
2. Clean the dataset by handling missing values and correcting data types.
3. Engineer new features for deeper insights (e.g., usage categories).
4. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
5. Derive insights and write interpretations for each chart.
6. Apply grouping and aggregation to highlight trends.
7. Conclude with a storytelling summary of findings.

## 📊 Techniques & Tools Used
- **Python Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Data Cleaning:** Missing value handling, type conversions
- **Feature Engineering:** Categorizing daily usage patterns
- **EDA:** Bar charts, Pie Charts and grouped analysis
- **Insights:** Interpretations alongside visualizations

## 📝 Key Insights
- Most students fall into moderate usage, but a significant portion engage in heavy usage.
- Excessive usage is linked to lower academic performance and higher stress levels.
- Students limiting social media to under 3 hours daily tend to perform better academically.
- Balanced and mindful usage supports healthier study habits and focus.

## 📖 Storytelling Conclusion
The data tells a clear story: while moderate social media usage can coexist with academic success, excessive engagement often undermines performance and well-being. Students who manage their screen time wisely maintain better focus, reduced stress, and healthier study patterns. The findings emphasize the importance of balance in the digital age.
