# UPI Transaction Analysis - Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This capstone project provides a comprehensive analysis of UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction data in India. The analysis explores transaction patterns, trends, regional insights, and payment behavior across different time periods and demographics.

## Project Structure

### 📁 Folders
- **`python-notebooks/`** - Jupyter notebooks containing data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **`sql_scripts/`** - SQL queries for data extraction and transformation
- **`Power_BI_Dashboard/`** - Interactive Power BI dashboard files for visualization
- **`Data_exported_for_dashboard/`** - Processed datasets used in the dashboard
- **`Images/`** - Charts, graphs, and visualization outputs

## Key Features
- **Transaction Trend Analysis:** Examining UPI transaction volumes and values over time
- **Regional Insights:** State-wise and district-wise transaction patterns
- **Payment Behavior:** Analysis of transaction amounts, frequencies, and user preferences
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Power BI visualizations for stakeholder presentations
- **SQL Data Processing:** Efficient data extraction and transformation workflows

## Technologies Used
- **Python** - Data analysis and visualization
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
  - Jupyter Notebook
- **SQL** - Data querying and transformation
- **Power BI** - Interactive dashboard creation
- **Excel/CSV** - Data storage and export

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter
```

### Running the Analysis
1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Navigate to `python-notebooks/` folder
   - Open and run Jupyter notebooks in sequence
   
2. **SQL Queries:**
   - Execute scripts in `sql_scripts/` folder against your database
   
3. **Power BI Dashboard:**
   - Open `.pbix` file in `Power_BI_Dashboard/` folder
   - Connect to data sources in `Data_exported_for_dashboard/`

## Key Insights
This analysis reveals important trends in India's digital payment ecosystem, including:
- Growth patterns in UPI adoption
- Regional variations in digital payment usage
- Transaction size distribution and user behavior
- Peak transaction periods and seasonal trends

## Capstone Project
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis capabilities including:
- Data extraction and cleaning
